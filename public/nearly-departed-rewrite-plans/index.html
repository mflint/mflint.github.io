<blockquote><p>This is part 3 of a multi-part series:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/nearly-departed-rewrite-intro/">Part 1</a>: intro</li>
<li><a href="/nearly-departed-rewrite-tech-background/">Part 2</a>: tech background</li>
<li>Part 3: rewrite plans</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>Goals</h3>

<ul>
<li>Rewrite in Swift</li>
<li>&hellip; in a <em>Swifty</em> way</li>
<li>With a decent set of unit tests</li>
<li>Same features as the existing app:

<ul>
<li>departure boards (all departures from a station)</li>
<li>station alerts (problems with services in this area)</li>
<li>service alerts (problems with this particular service)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New features:

<ul>
<li>Show service details (the progress of an individual service during its journey)</li>
<li>Reinstate Apple Watch support</li>
<li>Architect the code so it wouldn&rsquo;t be impossible to add different datasources in the future</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Non-goals</h3>

<ul>
<li>Making money - this is primarily a learning exercise</li>
</ul>


<h3>Data models</h3>

<p><strong>We&rsquo;ll start by talking about <em>Routes</em>.</strong> A route provides data for a request, and is user-defined in one of two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>Explicitly, via the iOS app. (example: all departures from York to Leeds would be an instance of <code>DarwinDeparturesRoute</code>)</li>
<li>Implicitly, from another route. (example: when viewing departures from York to Leeds, they might tap on a service to see its progress. This <code>DarwinServiceRoute</code> would be created automatically, containing the <code>serviceID</code> for the selected service)</li>
</ol>


<p>There is also a <code>NoRoutesRoute</code>. I&rsquo;m starting to develop an irrational dislike of optionals, so try to avoid them wherever I can. So if the user hasn&rsquo;t yet created any routes, we have a <code>NoRoutesRoute</code> there instead. (Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinrutherford">Kevin Rutherford</a> for the inspiration to go down this route, with his &ldquo;write a program with no if statements&rdquo; kata)</p>

<p>We need something to manage our collection of routes, and that&rsquo;s in the <code>RouteManager</code>. The user&rsquo;s <em>explicit</em> routes are stored in a collection, but we also allow other routes to pushed to form a stack, so the user can drill-down from one result to another.</p>

<p>This might seem complex, but it allows the user to manage scenarios like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>User travelling from A to B, then B to C</li>
<li>User creates explicit routes &ldquo;A to B&rdquo; and &ldquo;B to C&rdquo;</li>
<li>When starting their journey, they select route &ldquo;A to B&rdquo; to see if their service is on-time</li>
<li>Then they tap on the <em>service</em> to create an implicit Service route, which is popped onto the stack. They use this to track the progress of the service they&rsquo;re travelling on</li>
<li>But they also want to see if the &ldquo;B to C&rdquo; service is running OK</li>
<li>So they select the &ldquo;B to C&rdquo; route, and tap on a service to create a second implicit Service route, which is popped onto <em>that</em> stack</li>
<li>Then they can switch between stacks, to keep track of both <em>services</em></li>
</ul>


<script src="/javascripts/mermaid.min.js"></script>


<div class="mermaid">
graph LR
RM[RouteManager]-->E1["Explicit route 1<br/>(example: A to B)"]
RM[RouteManager]-->E2["Explicit route 2<br/>(example: B to C)"]
subgraph stack
E2-->I2["Implicit pushed route<br/>(example: 08:45 service from B to C)"]
end
subgraph stack
E1-->I1["Implicit pushed route<br/>(example: 08:00 service from A to B)"]
end
</div>


<p>This collection of stacks is stored in shared <code>UserDefaults</code>, so you could push a new route using the iPhone and then view its results on the Apple Watch.</p>

<p><strong>Next, we&rsquo;ll need to get fetch data from an API</strong> for each type of route using <code>Entity</code> types which can fetch a particular kind of data. Right now there are two, but there could be more in the future:</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>DarwinDeparturesEntity</code></dt>
<dd>gets OpenLDBWS departure boards for services between two stations (departures from station A calling at station B)</dd>
<dt><code>DarwinServiceEntity</code></dt>
<dd>gets OpenLDBWS service information (which returns the arrival/departure times for a service at each calling-point)</dd>
</dl>

<p><strong>Which brings us to <em>results</em>.</strong> Each type of route has a corresponding <code>ResultSet</code> containing a collection of <code>Result</code> objects. Those <code>Result</code> objects can represent either a <em>service departing from a station</em>, or a <em>calling point for a single service</em>. And - to enable the user to drill-down - each <code>Result</code> can have provide a child <code>Route</code>, which defines the next query.</p>

<p>In the next post, I&rsquo;ll describe how route definitions are stored, and how they&rsquo;re synchronised between iPhone and Watch.</p>
