    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m re-writing one of my apps, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nearly-departed/id982783760?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Nearly Departed</a>, in Swift. There are four main reasons for this:</p>

<ol>
<li>it&rsquo;s written in Objective C, not Swift - and I desperately need some more exposure to Swift</li>
<li>the code is difficult to maintain</li>
<li>there are some features I want to add which can&rsquo;t easily be done with the current codebase</li>
<li>fun</li>
</ol>


<p><a href="https://twitter.com/dwroboheadz">Someone</a> asked me to blog this, so here I am. This will hopefully chronicle the rewrite, until:</p>

<ul>
<li>I get bored of writing blogposts</li>
<li>Dev stops, because I get distracted with something else, or</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s released in the App Store</li>
</ul>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p><em>Nearly Departed</em> is an app to show live train departures in the UK. It doesn&rsquo;t do timetables, journey-planning or ticket purchases: just the live departures. It has an iOS app, of course, plus a today widget which can be accessed quickly from the iPhone lock screen. For a brief period, there was an Apple Watch <em>glance</em> too (until a WatchOS update broke the synchronisation mechanism).</p>

<p>Here are some slightly old screenshots to show what it looks like:</p>

<img class="left" src="/images/nearly-departed-1-widget.jpg" width="320" height="480" title="title alt" ></p>

<p>I wrote <em>Nearly Departed</em> in mid-2015, because I couldn&rsquo;t find a UK train departures app that I really liked. I was using <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/uk-train-times/id306687757?mt=8">&ldquo;UK Train Times&rdquo; by Agant</a>, which is a great app, but it wasn&rsquo;t quite right for me:</p>

<ol>
<li>the updates were infrequent and I was worried it would stop being supported</li>
<li>there was no really quick way to access live-departure information (like an iOS today widget)</li>
<li>no Apple Watch support</li>
</ol>


<p>If none of these things matter to you, then <em>UK Train Times</em> is well worth the purchase price.</p>

<p>So, like any good developer, I started to write my own.</p>

<h3>Feature summary</h3>

<p>To give a little more context about the app, here are the major features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Show <em>live departure</em> information for pre-defined direct routes on the UK train network</li>
<li>Display this information in iOS app or today widget</li>
<li>Auto-reverse routes, based on time (morning/afternoon) or user&rsquo;s location (if location services are enabled)</li>
</ul>

<p>In the next post, I&rsquo;ll discuss the technical implementation of the app, which should start to explain why I&rsquo;m rewriting it.</p>
