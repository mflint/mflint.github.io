Mermaid provides “generation of diagrams and flowcharts from text in a similar manner as markdown”. I wanted to add charting support to the blog (running on Octopress), these are the steps I took to get things working.

download

The best place I found to download mermaid is the dist folder (https://github.com/knsv/mermaid/tree/master/dist) of the mermaid github repo.

mermaid.full.min.js to /source/javascripts/mermaid.full.min.js
mermaid.css to /source/stylesheets/mermaid.css
integrate

I found the (jekyll-mermaid)[https://github.com/jasonbellamy/jekyll-mermaid] plugin and installed it.

In addition to the instructions on the plugin page I had to mannuall add an entry into the Gemfile for rake to pick it up:

group :development do
  gem 'rake', '~> 10.0'
  gem 'jekyll', '~> 2.0'
  # ...snip
  gem 'jekyll-mermaid', '~> 1.0.0'
end
