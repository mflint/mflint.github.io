I'm re-writing one of my apps, [Nearly Departed][itunes], in Swift. There are four main reasons for this:

1. it's written in Objective C, not Swift - and I desperately need some more exposure to Swift
2. the code is difficult to maintain
3. there are some features I want to add which can't easily be done with the current codebase
4. fun

[Someone][someone] asked me to blog this, so here I am. This will hopefully chronicle the rewrite, until:

* I get bored of writing blogposts
* Dev stops, because I get distracted with something else, or
* It's released in the App Store

### Background

_Nearly Departed_ is an app to show live train departures in the UK. It doesn't do timetables, journey-planning or ticket purchases: just the live departures. It has an iOS app, of course, plus a today widget which can be accessed quickly from the iPhone lock screen. For a brief period, there was an Apple Watch _glance_ too (until a WatchOS update broke the synchronisation mechanism).

Here are some slightly old screenshots to show what it looks like:

I wrote _Nearly Departed_ in mid-2015, because I couldn't find a UK train departures app that I really liked. I was using ["UK Train Times" by Agant][agant-app], which is a great app, but it wasn't quite right for me:

1. the updates were infrequent and I was worried it would stop being supported
2. there was no really quick way to access live-departure information (like an iOS today widget)
3. no Apple Watch support

If none of these things matter to you, then _UK Train Times_ is well worth the purchase price.

So, like any good developer, I started to write my own.


### Feature summary

To give a little more context about the app, here are the major features:

* Show _live departure_ information for pre-defined direct routes on the UK train network
* Display this information in iOS app or today widget
* Auto-reverse routes, based on time (morning/afternoon) or user's location (if location services are enabled)

###Â Next

In the next post, I'll discuss the technical implementation of the app, which should start to explain why I'm rewriting it.
