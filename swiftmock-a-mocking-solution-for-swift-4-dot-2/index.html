	<div class="entry-content"><p>In September 2015, I tried to write a mocking framework for Swift. It was over-engineered, difficult to use and quickly abandoned; I decided instead that simple fakes would suffice.</p>

<p>That all changed earlier this year. I was writing much more Swift, both at home (for the <em>Nearly Departed</em> rewrite) and in my day-job, and realised that mocks really are necessary if we want to thoroughly test how our classes interact with collaborators.</p>

<p>tl;dr: <code>SwiftMock</code> is <a href="https://github.com/mflint/SwiftMock">available on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h3>Note about my personal test approach</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m firmly in the &ldquo;mockist TDD practitioner&rdquo; camp. I exercise my system-under-test in isolation, and provide test doubles for all of its collaborators. My tests exercise the <em>public interface</em> of the system-under-test; they care that the system-under-test did the right thing, not <em>why</em> it did the right thing.</p>

<h3>Various kinds of test doubles</h3>

<p><a href="https://martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a> write a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">great article on mocking and stubbing</a> in 2007, and explains things much better than I ever could. But briefly:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <em>test double</em> is a substitute implementation of a component which your system-under-test collaborates with</li>
<li>there are various kinds of test doubles, including:

<ul>
<li>mocks - which have explicit expectations, assert those expectations and will reject unexpected calls</li>
<li>stubs - which are primed to simply return data into your system-under-test; they feed data into your system</li>
<li>fakes - which are simple reimplementations of a collaborator interface (or Swift protocol)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s briefly discuss these.</p>

<h4>Mock function calls</h4>

<p>I would mock a call if the collaborator is performing a useful action on behalf of the system-under-test. In this case, my test <em>really does care</em> that the expected function is called on the collaborator class, and should fail if that expectation fails.</p>

<p>Examples would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>telling some <code>User</code> object to <code>logout()</code></li>
<li>asking a <code>DataSource</code> object to <code>beginNetworkRequest()</code></li>
<li>asking a <code>Timer</code> object to <code>startTimer(delay: 5)</code></li>
</ul>


<p>Mocked function calls:</p>

<ul>
<li>can have any number of parameters which usually must be checked (so the test should fail if you expect <code>startTimer(delay: 5)</code> but the code actually calls <code>startTimer(delay: 10)</code>)</li>
<li>often have a <code>Void</code> return type</li>
<li>typically have a verb-like name</li>
</ul>


<h4>Stubbed function calls</h4>

<p>A stubbed call is simply used to pass data into your system-under-test. In this case, my test <em>doesn&rsquo;t care</em> if this function is called or not; it only cares that the system-under-test produces the correct output.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>getting a <code>UserModel</code> struct from a <code>User</code> object</li>
<li>getting the <code>isRequesting</code> state from an object which performs network requests</li>
<li>getting the current <code>UserPreferences</code> object from a <code>PreferenceStore</code> collaborator</li>
</ul>


<p>Stubbed functionality:</p>

<ul>
<li>is either a read-only property, or is a function with no parameters</li>
<li>return a non-void result</li>
</ul>


<p>This distinction between mocks and stubs is important; while you <em>can</em> use mocks everywhere, this can lead to fragile tests. You&rsquo;ll eventually find yourself adding expectations that you don&rsquo;t care about, just to make the tests pass.</p>

<h3>Mixing mocked and stubbed calls in a single test double</h3>

<p><a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">Martin&rsquo;s article</a> suggests that a test double would either be a mock, <em>or</em> a stub, <em>or</em> a fake - but I find this choice of mocking or stubbing depends on the <em>function</em> being called, not to the whole object.</p>

<p>Take this protocol as an example of a collaborator:</p>

<pre><code>protocol User {
    var isLoggingIn: Bool { get }
    func login(username: String, password: String)
    func logout()
    func model() -&gt; UserModel
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>isLoggingIn</code> is a read-only property, so is a great candidate for stubbing. Our system-under-test might produce some output like &ldquo;Logging you in&rdquo;, and our test will assert that this output is generated. But it doesn&rsquo;t care <em>how</em> the system-under-test produced the correct output - because that&rsquo;s testing the <em>internal</em> workings of the system-under-test.</p>

<p><code>login(username: password:)</code> and <code>logout()</code> functions would be mocked. Their names are verbs, suggesting that they are performing some important action on behalf of our system-under-test.</p>

<p><code>model()</code> call would be stubbed. It simply returns a value, it&rsquo;s name is a noun, and it could be substituted for a property. My tests doesn&rsquo;t care if this is called or not; but if the system-under-test does call this function, my test would have some other assertions on a different observable outcome.</p>

<h3>How SwiftMock can help your project</h3>

<p><em>SwiftMock</em> can help you assert the correctness of your code, if your tests are more in the <em>mockist</em> style - where you substitute all of your collaborators with test doubles.</p>

<p>It will:</p>

<ul>
<li>allow you to set explicit expectations on a function call</li>
<li>check the supplied parameters to the call are correct</li>
<li>allow you to return values from the call back into the system-under-test</li>
<li>optionally perform actions when a function is called (using a <code>doing</code> block), so function arguments can be captured</li>
<li>fail-fast if unexpected calls are made</li>
</ul>
